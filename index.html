      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>This policy is effective as of 26 August 2020.</p>
      <p>
        LUN LLC (a legal entity, incorporated and acting under the legislation
        of Ukraine) (referred to as "us", or "we", or "our") developed the Мій
        ЛУН (My LUN) mobile application (referred to as the "Service") as free
        app. This Service is operated by us and is intended for use as is. Your
        privacy is important to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and
        disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you
        have associated with that data (referred to as the "Policy"). Please
        read this Policy carefully. By using our Service, you are agreeing and
        consenting to the collection and processing of your data as set out
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a
        service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your
        knowledge and consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide
        you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect
        within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well
        as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
      </p>

      <h2>Information Collection</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Information you give us:</b> We will collect the information that you
        give to us when using our Application. We may collect information that
        you provide to us when you register as a registered user (namely – your
        name, phone number and e-mail). We may also collect in anonymous form
        other information about you at the same time, such as details of the
        sort of property you are interested in, the cost and location of the
        property etc. We will also collect information that you provide to us by
        corresponding with us by e-mail or otherwise
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Information we collect about you:</b> This is different to
        "information you give us" because it relates to technical data that we

        the potential to identify you, such as the internet protocol (IP)
        address used to connect your phone to the internet, your login
        information, time zone setting, operating system and version. All this
        information is collected by us to improve our Service.
